Recicla MX is a directory of recycling centers of Mexico where users can vote and suggest as a community and keep the information up to date.

This is my final project for CS50, for more information:

[https://cs50.harvard.edu/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/)

For now the site is Spanish, but there is a little of information in English if you want to take a look at:
[www.reciclamx.info/cs50](https://www.reciclamx.info/cs50)

Some points to consider:

+ You will need to set an environment Variable named MAPS_API_KEY.
+ Need a gmail account to set on line 313 of application.py to work.
+ Set permissions for votelogs.txt if need it (chmod)
+ Remember to install dependencias in your virtualenv.

Will try to keep getting the project better in time.
Thanks!
